<p>I had a great time attending the PDC virtually. Azure, <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/pdc2008/TL16/">C#</a>, <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/pdc2008/TL36/">Xaml</a>—these all were cool. The tech I was most excited about was Oslo, specifically building custom <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/pdc2008/TL31/">DSLs with MGrammar</a>.</p>  <p>Having spent a lot of time in Xaml and C# at Microsoft and migrating to a world of Ruby and JavaScript and HTML/CSS and HAML/SASS, I've had my hands in a lot of tools. And I have lots of questions and thoughts for the community. And, specifically, <a href="http://www.simplegeek.com/">Chris</a>, <a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/community/blogs/dbox/">Don</a>, <a href="http://douglaspurdy.com/">Doug</a>, <a href="http://tinyfinger.blogspot.com/">Pinky</a>, and the gang.</p>  <p>When I talk about a 'logical', I'm talking about MSchema in Oslo terminology--at least I think so.</p>  <ol>   <li>Where&#160; is the MGrammar for C#? </li>    <li>…for VB? </li>    <li>…for CSV? </li>    <li>…for VS Solution files? </li>    <li>…for XML? </li>    <li>Could C#/VB implement their compilers using MGrammar? Should they? Would they?      <ul>       <li>I’m imagining the tools I could write if I had the grammar…and could insert myself in pre-compile stage. Awesome. </li>        <li>What an amazing better-together with C#'s new compiler-as-service. </li>     </ul>   </li>    <li>There should be standardized or defacto escape mechanisms for existing grammars.      <ul>       <li>&quot;If you want to inject your own magic into [C#|VB|XML|etc] use this (relatively) safe/constrained notation.&quot; </li>        <li>I'm thinking about a subset of <a href="http://haml.hamptoncatlin.com/docs/rdoc/classes/Sass.html">SASS</a> markup for WPF styles that I could in-line in XAML and have processed at build-time. </li>     </ul>   </li>    <li>Could the MGrammar for XAML just party off the MGrammar for XML? </li>    <li>…could it be written without referring to 'physical' XML, and instead just refer to the XML MSchema model? </li>    <li>If I had a MGrammar for <a href="http://haml.hamptoncatlin.com/">HAML</a> that could generate most of ‘logical’ XML, could I then 'infer' the 'XAML in HAML' using #9? </li>    <li>Will there be tools to go back from a logical model (MSchema) to the input format? I'd like to store data in a logical model, but be able to allow editing via the text format. </li>    <li>How about tools that allow the comparison of two grammars to see if they generate the same MSchema--perhaps with different labels. Perhaps with the ability to convert between them. Perhaps with the ability to identify strict sub- or super-set grammars. </li>    <li>Where is the community site for MGrammar?      <ul>       <li>User-submitted grammars </li>        <li>User submitted and verified 'tests' against the grammars </li>        <li>Easy tracking of new (and old) versions </li>        <li>Easy tracking of forked/related grammars </li>     </ul>   </li>    <li>Want to have <a href="http://www.mgrammars.com/">MGrammars.com</a>? I registered it for Microsoft. I'll give it to ya'll for free. Just promise to make a great community site. </li>    <li>I'll even build the site for you. It'll give me an excuse to use <a href="http://azure.com/">Azure</a>. I'm happy to offer my <a href="http://kevinmooreconsulting.com/">consulting services</a>. </li>    <li>Any news with Mono? Is Miguel interested? </li>    <li>Are you making a play to make MGrammar a standard? I've heard yes, but just wanted to confirm. </li>    <li>How is the computer science behind MGrammar? Is it as good/better than existing tools? BNF? Lex/Yacc? Others? Is there a write-up? I'd love to see where MGrammar is pushing the state-of-the-art. </li>    <li>Anyone pushing a normalized Wiki grammar? Like <a href="http://www.riehle.org/2008/01/09/an-ebnf-grammar-for-wiki-creole-10/">this</a>? Yes, a weird point, but think of how much IQ in the world is stored in Wikipedia and it's next to impossible to parse because MediaWiki format has a bunch of random PHP parsing quirks. A great intern project. </li>    <li>As you can tell, super excited about the project, guys. Keep it up. </li> </ol>
