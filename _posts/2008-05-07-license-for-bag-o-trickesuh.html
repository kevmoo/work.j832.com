<p>I might as well handles the two &quot;<a href="http://work.j832.com/2008/05/bag-o-tricks-datepicker-controluh.html">90% issues</a>&quot; together.</p>  <p>A lot of people ask about the license for the <a href="http://j832.com/bagotricks/">bag-o-tricks</a>.</p>  <p>Here's the story.</p>  <p>Most of the code in the bag-o-tricks was written while I was at Microsoft. I never took the time to formally license it while at Microsoft.</p>  <p>Given the type of code and how it's been released, I <em>think</em> it's more than safe to consider it under the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/resources/sharedsource/licensingbasics/publiclicense.mspx">Microsoft Public License</a>.</p>  <p>I say &quot;I think&quot; because I'm not a lawyer and I'm not 100% sure how to deal with code that I wrote while at Microsoft--and therefor, technically, &quot;owned&quot; by Microsoft.</p>  <p>I'd bet $10 you won't get sued if you use it any way you see fit. But that's as far as I'll stick my neck out. Being on the other side of the fence from the MSFT legal department is a bit...uh...interesting.</p>  <p>Everything that's new since I left I've put under the <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php">MIT license</a>, which I find pretty good.</p>  <p>I'm trying to keep a clear firewall between that code, even going so far as to keep the namespaces separate.</p>  <p>I hope this helps a little. I know folks are looking to use individual controls in their commercial applications.</p>  <p>While I can't give you a 100% guarantee about the code, I can say I'm pretty sure you have nothing to worry about.</p>  <p>I'm not sure if that sounds more like lawyer speak or marketing speak.</p>  <p>Happy hacking (except where prohibited)</p>
