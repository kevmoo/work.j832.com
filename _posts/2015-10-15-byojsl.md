There's a lot of JavaScript libraries. It'd be nice if you could use them
seamlessly from Dart, while maintaining Dart's developer-friendly ergonomics.

At the Dart Summit in April, Dan and I [talked about our plans](url) for the future of JavaScript interop: the hashtag-able `#byojsl` – *Bring Your Own JavaScript Library*.

With the latest preview release of Dart 1.13 – *1.13.0-dev.7*, you can now play with this feature.

Check out the [example](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/tree/master/pkg/js/example) in the [source code](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/tree/master/pkg/js).

Nice, huh?

Creating the Dart interop libraries using `@Js()` annotations allows `dart2js` to create very efficient Javascript connections to the source library. The interop libraries also give the users of the interop library the developer experience you expect from Dart code: completions, warnings, errors, etc.

If you want to try it out

* Download the latest *dev* release of the Dart SDK - [dartlang.org/downloads/archive](https://www.dartlang.org/downloads/archive/)
* The package is published at [pub.dartlang.org/packages/js](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/js).
* Make sure you specify the right constraint in `pubspec.yaml` – `js: ^0.6.0-beta`

We'll have *proper* documentation on the site when 1.13 is ready for release. In the mean time, we'd love feedback as we prepare for the final release.
