<img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;width: 87px; height: 111px;border: none;" src="http://rubyonrails.org/images/rails.png" border="0" alt="" />I had a friend ask me if I'd be willing to teach him <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a>. I said sure. Then I got to thinking: what would it take? Take a code-savvy person and teach them enough <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> and <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a> and <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Base.html">ActiveRecord</a> to get them moving.<br /><br />So I'm going to try it on Friday. Maybe just with Donald, but if anyone else wants to join us on Capitol Hill in Seattle, you're welcome.<br /><br />Requirements:<br /><ol><li>Have done some coding.</li><li>Have some experience with web sites, HTML, etc.</li><li>Have a Mac.</li><li>Free on Friday, Dec 18, in the afternoon.</li><li>The catch: you must bring proof of at least a $50 donation to the <a href="http://www.eff.org/">EFF</a>, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a>, or <a href="http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Home">WikiMedia</a>. (If you're in a tight spot, we can talk.)</li></ol><div>Drop me an email at <i>ror4aday (at) j832 (dot) com</i> if you're interested. I might do something slightly more formal in January, too.</div><div><br /></div><div>See you on Friday.</div>
