<p>90% of the questions I get on the <a href="http://j832.com/bagotricks/">bag-o-tricks</a> fall into one of two buckets.</p>  <p>The first bucket is DatePicker.</p>  <p>While I'd love to take credit (or perhaps blame) for it, I didn't build it.</p>  <p>It was done as a demo by some engineers in a Microsoft office in China.</p>  <p>I have the slightest clue how it is built or how it works (other than I'm pretty sure I'd do a total 180 if I were to try to implement the same functionality.)</p>  <p>I've got a number of bug reports and feature requests. I'm sorry for being quiet on them. DatePicker really doesn't line up with anything I'm playing with at the moment...so I haven't spent much (read &quot;any&quot;) time on it.</p>  <p>If anyone has bug fixes or new features, as always, send me me an SVN patch and I'll be happy to get things fixed.</p>  <p>Alternatively, you can always offer to shower me with cash and lavish gifts to dig in on your favorite problem.</p>  <p>I'm not above being bought. :-)</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>Oh, and it's great being back in Seattle. India was great, but there's no place like home.</p>
