<p>Do you deploy the .NET Framework 3.0 with your application installation? Would you like a better experience for your users with framework + application installation?</p> <p>The WPF team has done some work to make this process easier for both application authors and end-users.</p> <p>Before we make the code generally available, we'd love to have some folks give it a dry run.</p> <p>Drop me an <a href="mailto:il3obom02@sneakemail.com">email</a> if you'd like to give our code a test drive or if you have questions.</p> <p>We're hoping to make the install part of your app experience more enjoyable for everyone.</p>
