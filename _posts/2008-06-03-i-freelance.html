<p>It's seems like only 8 month ago that I was <a href="http://work.j832.com/2007/09/i-leaving-microsoft.html">leaving a job</a>. It's just too much fun to switch around my insurance and investment plans, I guess.</p>  <p>I've had a great time at <a href="http://actman.com/">AMC</a>. I proved to myself I can be happy being a developer full-time--something that worried me after five years as a program manager at Microsoft.</p>  <p>I'll miss working with <a href="http://www.actman.com/contacts/paul.html">Paul</a> and <a href="http://dpotter.net/Technical/">David</a>. Working day-to-day with David has been amazing. One of the hardest working and sweetest guys I know. He's made be a better developer and probably a better person.</p>  <p>What's next?</p>  <p>On June 16 I enter the wonderful, terrifyingly independent world of software consulting and freelancing.</p>  <p>My first gig will be helping out some good friends and former MS co-workers at <a href="http://www.jacksonfish.com/">Jackson Fish Market</a>.</p>  <p>You'll hear all about the project when it's done. All I can say now: <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> and a little <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flash/">Flash</a>.</p>  <p>I can't wait to hear the comments about either leaving or go to the dark side.</p>  <p>Yes, I've been spending time at the <a href="http://store.apple.com/us">Apple Store</a>. Scary.</p>  <p>No, I'm not giving up the MS stack. I'm hoping to have the chance to do consulting and freelance work in WPF and Silverlight, too.</p>  <p>While I'm likely booked for over a month, I'll be looking for gig+1, +2, etc. shortly.</p>  <p>If you would like to chat about my services, please drop me an line: edeya9902(at)sneakemail(dot)com.</p>  <p>In the mean time, happy hacking.</p>
