<p>By Joel, I mean <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/">Joel Spolsky</a>. Not only does he have great taste in <a href="http://www.barackobama.com/">presidential candidates</a>, but he's a person everyone in technology should be reading.</p>  <p>It's good to have idols, I think. I dream of having the perspective and wisdom to write like <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2008/03/17.html">this</a>.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>The IE 8 team is in the process of making a decision that lies perfectly, exactly, precisely on the fault line smack in the middle of two different ways of looking at the world. It&#8217;s the difference between conservatives and liberals, it&#8217;s the difference between &quot;idealists&quot; and &quot;realists&quot;, it&#8217;s a huge global jihad dividing members of the same family, engineers against computer scientists, and Lexuses vs. olive trees. </p> </blockquote>  <p>Of course he's talking about how IE8 will handle web standards when so much of the world expects IE to work the way it has always worked. Is there a solution? According to Joel:</p>  <blockquote>   <p><em>There is no solution</em>. Each solution is terribly wrong. Eric Bangeman at <em>ars technica</em> <a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20071219-ie8-goes-on-an-acid2-trip-beta-due-in-first-half-of-2008.html">writes</a>, &quot;The IE team has to walk a fine line between tight support for W3C standards and making sure sites coded for earlier versions of IE still display correctly.&quot; This is incorrect. It&#8217;s not a fine line. It's a line of negative width. There is no place to walk. They are damned if they do and damned if they don't.</p> </blockquote>  <p>His Martian headset analogy is just a bit forced, but totally forgiven. The write-up is brilliant and fascinating.</p>  <p>Like Joel, I'm going to sit back with some popcorn.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>...it will be really, really entertaining to watch...</p></blockquote>
