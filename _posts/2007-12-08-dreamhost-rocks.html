<p align="center"><a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?368099"><img src="http://j832.com/workBlogFiles/2007-12-08_DreamHostLogo.png" /></a> </p>  <p>I've been all over the map with hosting services. Each has it's own cool features and things that are annoying.</p>  <p>I've finally found one that (almost) has it all: <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?368099">DreamHost</a>.</p>  <p>For $10 a month (paid yearly):</p>  <ul>   <li>5120 <strong>GB </strong>per month bandwidth. No, that is not a miss-type. Put another way: 5.120 <strong>TB</strong> a month. (Now, being realistic, the box it's hosted on would probably melt before you hit that mark. It's almost like offering 50,000 minutes on a cell phone plan when there's only 44,640 minutes in a month. But at least you won't get charged for a <a href="http://digg.com">Digg</a> hit or something.) </li>    <li>500 <strong>GB</strong> of storage. Again, not a typo. 0.5 <strong>TB</strong>. </li>    <li>As many domains as you want. You have to buy the domain names, but you can host 'em all on one account. </li>    <li>As many MySQL databases as you want. Size comes out of your 500 GB of storage so make 'em as big as you want. </li>    <li>Shell access. We're talkin' SSH. (Well, if I could figure out the damn certificate thingy.) I'm using 'ln -s' to create symbolic links for the first time in 6 years. Reminds me of <a href="http://www.iastate.edu/">college</a>... </li>    <li>The deal-maker: <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">SVN</a>. For those that don't mind (or prefer) OSS source control, this is it. I use it for all of my code and personal writing--all things I want to backup, sync reliably across machines, and keep version history on. I'll post later on my love of <a href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/">Tortoise</a>. </li>    <li>Oh, and they're <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?368099/green.cgi?j832.com">carbon neutral</a>. It's almost silly.</li> </ul>  <p>I said almost above. What's the catch?</p>  <p>Well, there's not a huge number of easy-to-install software packages. They don't use <a href="http://www.cpanel.net/index.html">cPanel</a>/<a href="http://netenberg.com/fantastico.php">Fantastico</a> like a lot of Linux hosting shops. The interface they do provide is very clean and one can manually install most things, but it's kinda nice to do a click-and-install for <a href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal</a>.</p>  <p>That's my only nit, actually. Everything is super fast. I'm super happy.</p>  <p><a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?368099">Check 'em out</a>.</p>  <p><em>But Kevin, this is a Linux hosting package. Where's the Windows Server 2008 package?</em></p>  <p>Sigh. The world is so much larger than the Microsoft stack of technologies. I love VS as much as anyone, but getting a broad skill set is important, right? Plus the OSS web community is insanely strong. The content, energy and enthusiasm are amazing.</p>  <p><em>Full disclosure: Yes, the links provided are for a referral program. Yes, I get a kick-back if you sign-up. No, I would never pitch anything just for the kick-back.</em></p>  <p><em>I've had plenty of services offer kick-backs that I blinked at--that I never felt strongly about. This is proof I have no subtext. These guys are that good.</em></p>
