Port <a href="https://github.com/kevmoo/pop-pop-win">Pop, Pop, Win!</a> to <a href="http://www.stagexl.org/">StageXL</a>. If you do a good job, you're code will get into the Dart SDK.</i><br /><br />When I wrote <a href="http://kevmoo.github.io/pop-pop-win/">Pop, Pop, Win!</a>&nbsp;I hacked together an HTML Canvas graphics library into <a href="https://github.com/kevmoo/bot_web.dart">bot_web</a>. The library –&nbsp;<a href="http://kevmoo.github.io/bot_web.dart/#bot_web/bot_retained">bot_retained</a>&nbsp;–&nbsp;did everything I needed, but I really haven't done much with it in over a year.<br /><br />In the mean time, <a href="http://www.stagexl.org/">StageXL</a> has been going nuts. It supports rendering to Canvas and WebGL. It supports <a href="http://www.stagexl.org/runtimes/texture_packer.html">Texture Packer</a>. <a href="https://github.com/bp74">Bernhard</a> has been keeping it fresh.<br /><br />I'm actively trying to cleanup a bunch of little projects I've built over the last couple of years. Deprecating my own retained graphics library and moving folks towards StageXL seems like goodness.<br /><br />Interested in doing the port?<br /><br />The source code for PPW now <a href="https://github.com/dart-lang/bleeding_edge/tree/master/dart/samples/pop_pop_win">lives in the Dart SDK</a>. I'd suggest doing a copy-paste of the project into a new Git repository and starting there. The graphics bits are pretty well isolated. If you're pretty serious and can show that you've made a stab, I'm happy to offer help.<br /><br />Dig in. Send me a link to your project on GitHub if you make progress or hit any bumps.<br /><br />Happy hacking!
