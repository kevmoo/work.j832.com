<p>This has happened a few times, so I thought it would be worth mentioning.</p>  <ol>   <li>I love comments. I try to blog more than &quot;check out this link&quot; posts. It takes a bit of work. Knowing folks are reading is great. But...</li>    <li>If you're saying more than &quot;interesting post&quot;--if you have comments or questions--please make sure I have a way to contact you.</li> </ol>  <p>Oleg Mihailik made an interesting comment about my <a href="http://work.j832.com/2008/01/responsive-ui-with-unresponsive-data.html">NotifyWorker post</a>:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>As long as you are already using the delegates, you can use closures (local variables) instead of creating artifical types to hold them.</p>    <p>Then you'd have to provide 2 parameterless delegates: one for work item and another for 'OnCompleted' logic on GUI thread.</p>    <p>That simplifies out the packaged parameters' class, AND eliminates the exception catching work by design.</p>    <p>If they care enough to handle exceptions, they'd do it in conventional and readable way: by enclosing the dangerous part in try/catch. And then, they can reflects it in exactly the same 'OnCompleted' delegate.</p> </blockquote>  <p>I have questions for him and I have no clue how to drop him a line.</p>  <p>If you'd like to chat (or talk job offers) please send me an email.</p>  <p>My obfuscated address--<em>edeya9902(at)sneakemail(dot)com</em>--in the left pane, is meant as a test. If you can't figure it out or don't want to go through the effort of doing the manual copy-paste-replace, we probably shouldn't chat.</p>  <p>Or if you post a comment, just make sure you link back to a blog with a contact page. That's more than sufficient.</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
