Mountains of folks use it. It’s awesome.</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/angular/angular.dart">Angular 1 Dart</a> was a hand-rolled port of Angular 1 JS. It tried to follow the JS flavor of the framework, while being a true Dart framework. While a lot of folks have used Angular 1 Dart, especially within Google, it turned out to be tough to maintain two separate versions of the same framework for two languages.</p> <p><strong>Enter Angular 2.</strong></p> <p>Angular 2 <a href="http://angularjs.blogspot.com/2014/10/ng-europe-angular-13-and-beyond.html">was pitched in October</a> as a better/faster framework built on AtScript – AtScript was an extension of TypeScript from the beginning.</p> <p><strong>Important point: Angular 2 has always been built on TypeScript.</strong></p> <p>The <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/somasegar/archive/2015/03/05/typescript-lt-3-angular.aspx">Angular/TypeScript announcement</a> is amazing news. The features that were added to AtScript are being pulled into TypeScript.</p> <p><strong>Important point: AtScript has been merged into TypeScript – one less language to worry about.</strong></p> <p>TypeScript lets the Angular folks build a framework that targets both Javascript and Dart simultaneously. Check out the Angular <a href="https://travis-ci.org/angular/angular">Travis page</a> to see build output for both languages.</p> <p><strong>Important point: Angular 2 has first class support for Javascript AND Dart out of the box.</strong></p> <p>This leaves us with <strong>THE BIG QUESTION:</strong></p> <p><strong>Why isn’t Angualr 2 just built in Dart?</strong></p> <p><strong>Answer</strong>: the Angular folks want to deliver a great framework for BOTH Javascript and Dart.</p> <p>Dart generates great Javascript for browsers, but we have work to do to generate reusable Javascript libraries.</p> <p>The Angular team needs to generate reusable Javascript libraries.</p> <p><em><strong>That’s it.</strong></em></p> <p>One of my personal goals is to make Dart great for generating JS libraries. We’ll have more to discuss at the <a href="https://www.dartlang.org/events/2015/summit/">Dart summit</a> in April – <em>psst – <a href="https://dartdevelopersummit.eventfarm.com">you should register</a></em>.</p> <p>In the mean time, check out the alpha of <a href="https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/angular2">Angular2 Dart package</a>.</p> <p>Check out the <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular">Angular GitHub project</a> if you want to play with Angular for Dart or Javascript – <em>OR BOTH</em>.</p> <p>File bugs. File feature requests. Send pull requests.</p> <p><em>I’ve had fun using the Dart analyzer to do a <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular/commit/fa259659395cf9f5b5f754af0c145302cafd9385">bunch</a> of <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular/commit/fb5b168b1928769d5680d78243f7e17e6e4a9457">cleanup</a> in the Angular source – it’s nice.</em></p> <p>Happy hacking – <em>now with 20% less <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty_and_doubt">FUD</a></em>.</p>
