<p>As I update the Bag-o-Tricks, I wanted to keep one URL for people to check to make sure they have the latest hotness.</p> <p>(This is a nod to Rob's <a href="http://robrelyea.com/UrlManifesto/">Url Manifesto</a>. While I pick on him a lot about this, I think it's a great way to think about the user model for the web.)</p> <p>Anyway, I'll keep <a href="http://j832.com/bagotricks">this page</a> updated with the latest info on the bag-o-tricks. (And, hopefully, a description of each demo/sample when I get some free time).</p> <p>I'll have some updates soon, I promise.</p>
