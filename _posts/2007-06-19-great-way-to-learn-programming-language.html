<p>I'm sure many have heard discussions about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Language_Runtime">DLR</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IronRuby">IronRuby</a>&nbsp;coming out of MIX07.</p> <p>As a guy who cares about great developer experiences and great user experiences, I've also paid some attention to <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>.</p> <p>So last night, I thought I'd dig in.</p> <p><a href="http://instantrails.rubyforge.org/wiki/wiki.pl">Instant Rails</a> seems to be a popular place to start. A one-stop-shop for Ruby + Rails + Apache + MySQL. All runs on Windows by just extracting a zip file. (The only hiccup I encountered was making sure that port 80 was available.)</p> <p>After I got things running and clicked around a bit, I realized I was trying to learn Japanese by picking up a book and trying to cross reference concepts to a Japanese-English dictionary.</p> <p>Not very effective.</p> <p>What I needed was a "vocabulary" and "grammar" introduction. (In quotes, because I'm referring to my Japanese analogy and not programming language constructs.)&nbsp;</p> <p>After the obvious search term--"<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=ruby+tutorial">ruby tutorial</a>"--I stumbled upon an amazing tool: <a href="http://tryruby.hobix.com/">Try Ruby</a>.</p> <p>Holy cow! A ruby interpreter in-browser. A great way to understand the language. I had a bit of trouble dealing with mistyped lines, but otherwise, it's an amazing tool.</p> <p>More programming languages should be presented this way.</p> <p>This is certainly worth a few hours on a Tuesday night.</p> <p>Kudos to the developers.&nbsp;</p>
