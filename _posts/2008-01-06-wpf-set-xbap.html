<p><em><font color="#ff0000">Update - 2008-01-06: See <a href="http://work.j832.com/2008/01/game-in-wpf-redux.html">this post</a> for new details. Links below have been changed.</font></em></p>  <p><em>In theory, I have so many more important projects to work on. This was one of those ideas that got legs faster than I realized I should be working on something else.</em></p>  <p>If you haven't heard of Set, check it out <a href="http://www.setgame.com/set/index.html">company site</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(game)">the Wikipedia entry</a>.</p>  <p align="center"><a href="http://j832.com/workBlogFiles/WPFSetXBAP_109C/image_3.png"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="304" alt="WPF Set - 2008-01-08" src="http://j832.com/workBlogFiles/WPFSetXBAP_109C/image_thumb.png" width="226" border="0" /></a> </p>  <p>Building the data model was half the fun. This is some of my first code that uses <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Integrated_Query">Linq</a> features from .NET 3.5. I'm blown away. Without a doubt as big as generics. Wow!</p>  <p>The UI is super minimal and that was the goal. Get it all working and ponder prettier/sexier things later.</p>  <p>So, if you want to play:</p>  <ul>   <li><a href="http://j832.com/workBlogFiles/WpfSet/">XBAP</a> - Requires <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=333325fd-ae52-4e35-b531-508d977d32a6&amp;displaylang=en">Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5</a>. (Works in IE and Firefox.) </li>    <li><a href="http://j832.com/workBlogFiles/J832.WpfSet.zip">Source and Binaries</a> [53KB zip] </li> </ul>  <p>As I've <a href="http://work.j832.com/2007/12/bag-o-tricks-christmas-edition.html">discussed before</a>, you can also take a look at the source on my <a href="http://j832.com/PublicSoftware/">SVN share</a> using you <a href="http://work.j832.com/2007/12/tortoisesvn-rocks.html">favorite SVN client</a>.</p>  <p>Future ideas:</p>  <ul>   <li>Add a timer and a notion of players. I think I'd layer this on top of the existing game model to keep things simple and clean. </li>    <li>It would be cool to layer a 3D UI on top of the game model, too. I have some crazy ideas based on the Flip3D stuff from the <a href="http://j832.com/bagotricks/">bag-o-tricks</a>. </li> </ul>  <p>Hope you enjoy it! </p>  <p><em>Note 1: Thanks to </em><a href="http://scorbs.com/"><em>Karen</em></a><em> for the </em><a href="http://scorbs.com/2006/06/04/vs-template-flexible-application/"><em>details on making an XBAP project</em></a><em>.</em></p>  <p><em><del>Note 2: I'll give a cookie to anyone who sends me an SVN patch that fixes the shapes so they match what's really in the game.
