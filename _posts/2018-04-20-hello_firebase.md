Hey, folks! Almost 3 years ago, I blogged about [moving my blog from Blogger to
GitHub](/2015/07/hello-github.html). It's high time I moved back to Google,
right?

Here's [the commit](https://github.com/kevmoo/work.j832.com/commit/141d0d9c61)
that updated my config.

The only other wiring was setting the `FIREBASE_TOKEN` in Travic-CI to the
value returned by running `firebase login:ci`. That's about it.

"push to deploy" still works like a champ. The turn-around is super fast.
Oh, and it's all on HTTPS.

Cool.

I promise I'll post something before 2020!
