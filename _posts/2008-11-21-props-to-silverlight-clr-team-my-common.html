<p>FTMP = For the most part</p>  <p>In Visual Web Developer 2008 Express Edition SP1 .NET XP Live.</p>  <ul>   <li>I created a new Silverlight control library, under my <a href="http://j832.com/PublicSoftware/">public SVN</a> location. </li>    <li>I did the right-click ‘Add Existing Item...’ trick. </li>    <li>I navigated to J832.Common and added all of the CS files (except DBUtil and ReaderWriterLockHelper). </li>    <li>And I hit build and watch it compile. </li> </ul>  <p>The result is a very <a href="http://j832.com/PublicSoftware/J832.SL.Common/">boring looking directory</a> with great potential: I can now use all of my common tricks in Silverlight, too.</p>  <p>You know, if I happen to be working on something in Silverlight. Hypothetically.</p>
