We’d all like a peek inside the mind of <a href="http://twitter.com/ericschmidt">Eric Schmidt</a>—beyond just understanding what he’s wearing in his twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/account/profile_image/ericschmidt">profile picture</a>. Search and maps and profiles: these all make sense. But there are a set projects that Google has been putting out lately that don't fit. They're open source and focused on the client machine.<div><ul><li>A <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome">browser</a>.</li><li>An <a href="http://www.chromium.org/chromium-os">operating system</a>.</li><li>An extension to HTTP - <a href="http://www.chromium.org/spdy/spdy-whitepaper">SPDY</a>.</li><li>An drastic evolution of AJAX - <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/websockets/">Web Sockets</a>.</li><li>A public <a href="http://code.google.com/speed/public-dns/">DNS service</a>.</li><li>A drastic evolution in web programming - <a href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/">Native Client</a>.</li></ul><div>Some of these are put under the banner of "making the web faster".</div><div>Let me go a step further.</div><div><br /></div><div>Google makes lots of money when you're clicking. The faster and more efficiently you consume their experiences, the more you click. The more you click, the more money Google makes.</div><div><br /></div><div>But there are bumps along the way.</div><div><div>Crappy ISPs</div><div>Out-dated operating system.</div><div>Outdated and/or bloated browsers, protocols, and programming languages.</div><div><br /></div><div>Google was silent on these for a long time--pushing existing technologies in novel or extreme ways--AJAX with Google Maps, Java Web Toolkit for Javascript, even shoe-horning <a href="http://code.google.com/chrome/chromeframe/">Chrome into IE</a>.</div><div><br /></div><div>In the end, the've decided to cut out the middle man.</div><div><br /></div><div>Ponder the stack of technology between you and Google's web offerings. When Eric Schmidt thinks about protocols, operating systems, and browsers--he has the same thoughts as Bill Gates did 20 years ago--about disk drives, CPUs and RAM.</div><div><br /></div><div>Make them solid. Make them better.</div><div><br /></div><div>But keep them out of the competitive picture.</div><div><br /></div><div>Commoditize.</div><div><br /></div><div>MSFT did it riding a wave of cheap PCs.</div><div>GOOG is doing it by riding a wave of free software.</div><div><br /></div></div></div>
