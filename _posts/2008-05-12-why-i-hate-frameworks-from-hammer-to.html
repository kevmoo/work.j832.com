<p>A recent discussion with a smart guy reminded me of an article I read years ago. I wanted to think I read it on <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/">Joel on Software</a>. I wanted to think it had something to do with &quot;hammer factories&quot;.</p>  <p>Google <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=hammer+factory+joel">did the rest</a>.</p>  <p>The write-up, <em><a href="http://discuss.joelonsoftware.com/default.asp?joel.3.219431.12">Why I Hate Frameworks</a></em> comes from <a href="http://discuss.joelonsoftware.com/default.asp?joel">Joel's discussion group</a>. Written by <a href="http://benjismith.net/">Benji Smith</a>.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>&quot;So, instead, we started selling schematic diagrams for hammer factories, enabling our clients to build their own hammer factories, custom engineered to manufacture only the kinds of hammers that they would actually need.&quot;</p>    <p>&quot;Let me guess. You don't sell those anymore.&quot;</p>    <p>&quot;Nope. Sure don't. As it turns out, people don't want to build an entire factory just to manufacture a couple of hammers. Leave the factory-building up to the factory-building experts, that's what I always say!!&quot;</p> </blockquote>  <p>Like most good content on the internet, brilliant <em>and</em> hilarious.</p>
