<p><em>Yes, I'm considering writing a book: &quot;Kevin Explores Things That Rock&quot;.</em></p>  <p>My company uses <a href="http://www.perforce.com/">Perforce</a> for source control. It works pretty well (although there is no shell integration and the Visual Studio integration is a bit flaky.)</p>  <p>I have my own projects on the side that I'd like to managed with source control. These are both code projects and non-code (poetry, screen plays, other writing) projects. Like <a href="http://work.j832.com/2007/12/dreamhost-rocks.html">I said</a>, anything that I want backed-up, synced and versioned.</p>  <p>If you're like me, you share a set of conflicting tendencies.</p>  <ul>   <li>First, a tendency to have many machines that you work on.</li>    <li>Second, a tendency to be paranoid about keeping important data backed-up and protected with good redundancy.</li>    <li>Third, a tendency to hate redundancy! This goes along with <a href="http://work.j832.com/2007/12/in-search-of-dry-spot.html">SPOT</a>. I hate when things get out of sync. I hate having things spread all over a bunch of machines.</li> </ul>  <p>Using a source control system helps a lot with this (especially if you're dealing with text-based data formats).</p>  <p>In the world of OSS, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subversion_(software)">Subversion</a> (SVN) is a big player in source management. It's supported by <a href="http://sourceforge.net/">SourceForge</a>. It's used by <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/testimonials.html#open-source-projects-using-svn">a mountain</a> of OSS projects. And (drum roll) it has an amazing Windows shell extension: <a href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/">Tortoise</a>.</p>  <ul>   <li>Step one: <a href="http://tortoisesvn.net/downloads">install</a>.</li>    <li>Step two: make directory somewhere on your machine.</li>    <li>Step three: right-click and pick &quot;SVN Checkout...&quot;</li>    <li>Step four: type in the URL of a <a href="http://j832.com/PublicSoftware/">public SVN repository</a>. There are many out there. Check the list above.</li>    <li>Step five: laugh at how easy it all is.</li> </ul>  <p>Tortoise supports the creation of patches. Renaming and branching. It even has great shell indicators so you know what's checked-in and what's pending check-in. (It works great on XP. So-so on Vista.)</p>  <p>Take a look at <a href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/">TortoiseSVN</a>.</p>  <p>If you're looking for hosting for your SVN repository, check out <a href="http://work.j832.com/2007/12/dreamhost-rocks.html">DreamHost</a>.</p>  <p>Happy Hacking...and don't forget to build an test before you check-in. :-)</p>
