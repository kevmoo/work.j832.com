<p>...or at least it makes me feel that way.</p>  <p>Let's rewind.</p>  <p>When I moved to Seattle in 2002, I had a simple, &quot;candy bar&quot; Nokia phone. I could barely text message with it, but it worked.</p>  <p>My first Windows Mobile phone was the Audiovox SMT5600--a fancy name for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTC_Typhoon">HTC Typhoon</a>. I could sync calendar and contacts over the air with Exchange. I could T9 through my address book.</p>  <p>I felt like I jumped 18 months into the future. I got the upgraded version of the Typhoon (with the weird bump on the top). It ran a newer version of Windows Mobile. It had a prettier screen. Let's say I jumped forward another 6 months.</p>  <p>Then I went <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlackJack_%28phone%29">BlackJack</a>. Bigger screen. Keyboard. A reasonable browsing experience, at least for GMail. Maybe a jump of a year into the future.</p>  <p>After a brief stint, I managed to loose my BlackJack, and went to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack_2">BlackJack 2</a>. Slicker look. Newer version of Windows Mobile. Maybe a 6 month jump.</p>  <p>Fast-forward to Sunday. I was snowboarding with some friends. My phone was in my pocket. My pocket was open. I was in the terrain park. I lot my phone.</p>  <p>Damn.</p>  <p>So I go back to the AT&amp;T store. And the iPhone stand starts calling to me.</p>  <p>I have many friends with iPhone.</p>  <p>Both of my brothers have one.</p>  <p>I get one.</p>  <p>It's been less than a week.</p>  <p>Easily a 5 year jump. I feel like I'm living in the future. The thing freakin' rocks. It makes the BlackJack2 look like a joke.</p>  <p>Not only have I ditched Windows Mobile, I've ditched Zune. I've gone to buying MP3s from Amazon's store. Instant gratification. No expiration. No DRM.</p>  <p>This is the future.</p>  <p>It flawlessly syncs with Outlook on my desktop. (I have a friend who's been trying to get it to work with her BlackJack for months.) The experience with iTunes is great. Maps, Email, SMS, all clean and beautiful.</p>  <p>With the announcement of the SDK and Enterprise support (over-the air sync with Exchange, etc) I can't imagine a better setup for a phone.</p>  <p>I'm sure Google will have a cool offer with <a href="http://code.google.com/android/">Android</a>. I'm sure MS is sweating bullets and cranking on some interesting stuff. At least I hope so.</p>  <p>In the end, the bar has been raised--by a lot. All mobile users will benefit in the long-run by the existence of iPhone.</p>  <p>Especially those that have one.</p>  <p>I couldn't imagine going back.</p>  <p>Let me say it again: wow.</p>
