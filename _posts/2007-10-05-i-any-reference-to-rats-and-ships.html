<p>On Monday, <a href="http://fortes.com/">Fil</a> made a note on Facebook listing the ~10 people he knew who had left MS this year. After a couple days and a few additions from friends, it was up to 16.</p>  <p>Earlier today I stumbled upon <a href="http://www.neopoleon.com/home/blogs/neo/archive/2007/09/30/27359.aspx">Rory's announcement</a>.</p>  <p>Then I discovered <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dthorpe/archive/2007/10/05/leaving-microsoft.aspx">Danny's post</a>.</p>  <p>Wow.</p>  <p>Maybe it's just that time of year.</p>  <p>Maybe it's that departures are more visible these days.</p>  <p>To use Microsoft's favorite overloaded statement: interesting.</p>
