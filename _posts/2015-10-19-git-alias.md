*tl;dr: Define personal, project-specific shell commands as a git alias. It's nice.*

I moved to Jekyll for my blog in July. To run the blog on my dev machine I need to run

```console
> bundle exec jekyll serve --baseurl ''
```

Not too crazy, but it's a pain to remember *every time* I want to run the dev server.

I could put a helper script in the root of the directory for my personal blog, but that's not an option with something like the Dart SDK.

```console
> ./tools/build.py --mode=release --arch=ia32 create_sdk
```

I could put an a shell alias in my `.profile`, but it doesn't make sense anywhere except the Dart SDK directory.

Enter [git aliases](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Git-Aliases).

I've [written about my global git aliases](http://work.j832.com/2013/09/my-global-git-aliases.html), but I've started using project-local aliases and I'm loving 'em.

For my blog, I tweak `.../myblog/.git/config` with:

```
[alias]
  jekyll-serve = !bundle exec jekyll serve --baseurl ''
```

For my clone of the Dart SDK:

```
[alias]
  create-sdk = "!./tools/build.py --mode=release --arch=ia32 create_sdk"
```

Try it out.

* Scoped to the current directory.
* Doesn't add any extra files to the repo that need to be ignored.
* Auto-complete nicely with `git<tab>`.
