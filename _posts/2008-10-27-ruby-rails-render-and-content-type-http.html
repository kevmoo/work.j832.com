Don't you hate it when you google for 30 minutes, trying to solve a simple problem, but for some reason the right combination of terms--or at least the combination of terms you think is right--fails.<br /><br />It just happened to me with a simple problem: change the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_headers">Content-Type HTTP Response Header</a> for  using standard Rails templates to be <code>text/xml</code>.<br /><br />The solution is pretty straight-forward:<blockquote><code>response.headers["Content-Type"] = 'text/xml'</code></blockquote>...as I eventually found <a href="http://snipplr.com/view/6463/header-content-type-in-rails-2/">here</a>.<br /><br />Setting this hash value in your <a href="http://apidock.com/rails/ActionController/Base">ActionController</a> action method does the trick.<br /><br />Here's hoping google picks this up and saves someone 20 minutes.
