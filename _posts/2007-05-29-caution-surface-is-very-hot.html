<p><a title="http://www.microsoft.com/surface/" href="http://www.microsoft.com/surface/">http://www.microsoft.com/surface/</a></p> <p>Let us talk about hotness. Holy hotness.</p> <p>I've never jumped up and down and laughed out loud more than when when I got to play with Surface.</p> <p>Scary-beyond-words cool stuff.</p> <p>I've been delighted to help the team with a few tweaks to WPF core controls to ensure they play nicely on Surface. It's a great showcase of the power of our platform (and a number of other MS graphics technologies.)</p> <p>Actually, very few tweaks were needed to WPF to support their scenarios. <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dwayneneed/">Dwayne</a> and friends did an amazing job designing an extensible input system. Mouse, keyboard and stylus were on the initial list of possible devices. Finger and drink glass just happened to plug in nicely.</p> <p>Here's to brilliant layering, huh?</p>
