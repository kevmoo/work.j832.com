<p>All of an hour ago, I <a href="http://work.j832.com/2007/06/keeping-track-of-bag-o-tricks.html">made a post</a> trying to bring sanity to the problem of finding the latest bag-o-tricks.</p> <p>Looks like Rob <a href="http://rrelyea.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns!167AD7A5AB58D5FE!2127.entry">thought of this 4 days ago</a>.</p> <p>Great minds, right?</p> <p>Or maybe I should just keep up on my blog reading.</p>
