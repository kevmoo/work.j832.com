<p>Way back in August, I <a href="http://work.j832.com/2007/08/video-what-new-in-wpf-for-2008.html">posted</a> about my <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/showpost.aspx?postid=332987">last Channel 9 interview</a> where I discussed new stuff in WPF for 3.5. At the time, I was a slacker about getting the code for the demos out.</p> <a href="http://rhizohm.net/irhetoric/blog/21/default.aspx"><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="269" alt="WPF 3.5 Demo Code" src="http://j832.com/workBlogFiles/_images/WPF3.5DemoPostedAddinsandInteractive3D_11BC1/image5.png" width="392" border="0" /></a>   <p>Well <a href="http://rhizohm.net/irhetoric">Karsten</a> has <a href="http://rhizohm.net/irhetoric/blog/21/default.aspx">picked up my slack</a>.</p>  <p><em>I only have C# 2008 Express installed and for some reason it doesn't like how complicated I made the solution, so I can't claim to have built/run the code as Karsten has posted it. I'm sure it's fine, though.</em></p>
