A lot has changed since then. I started my own consulting company. And then joined up with <a href="http://twitter.com/ingebretsen">Robby</a> to launch <a href="http://thinkpixellab.com/">Pixel Lab</a>.</p> <p>With previous releases, I was doing a very good job of breaking out almost all of the changes. This time, there are just too many. I’ll try to highlight the big ones.</p> <ul> <li>Added Org Tree. This is a pretty straight-forward sample of a vertical tree view.</li> <li>Added ReorderListBox. This is something Robby’s had for a while. I cleaned it up a bit for reuse.</li> <li>Added Show</li> <li>Removed the date controls. There are better versions in the official <a href="http://wpf.codeplex.com/">WPF Codeplex site</a>.</li> <li>Created AnimatingPanel abstract class. This is now the base class for AnimatingTilePanel <em>and</em> TreeMapPanel. All you have to tweak is call the protected virtual ArrangeChild in ArrangeOverride.</li> <li>A bunch of additions to the Common assembly.</li> <li>Moved main development over to VS 2010.</li> <li>Added support for Silverlight 4. You’ll find projects nested in the same folder. You’ll also notice #define #if #else for SILVERLIGHT which handles some special cases where things don’t work in both places.</li> <li>Added Vector for Silverlight. This allows a bunch of my helper methods and animation methods to work without code changes between the two frameworks.</li> <li>Added ObservableCollectionPlus&lt;T&gt;. This has a ReadOnly property, along with support for Sort and adds Move to Silverlight OC&lt;T&gt;.</li> <li>…and a bunch of other stuff I’m likely forgetting.</li></ul> <p>You can get the source (via SVN) at Codeplex: <a href="http://bot.codeplex.com/">http://bot.codeplex.com/</a></p> <p>You can download a sample app that runs against WPF 3.5 <a href="http://bot.codeplex.com/releases/view/43175">here</a>.</p> <p>The BOT has been the basis for Silverlight, WPF, and Windows Phone 7 apps I’ve written this year. Robby and I are going to keep tweaking it and updating it as we need new stuff.</p> <p>You should do the same.</p> <p>File bugs. Submit patches.</p> <p>Let’s make this <em>our</em> Bag of Tricks.</p> <p> </p> <p>Happy hacking,</p> <p>>Kevin</p><p>PS -> please make comments on the codeplex project discussion page! It's much easier to reply there. :-)</p>
