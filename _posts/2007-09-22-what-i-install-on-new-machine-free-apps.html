<p>Starting the new job, you start with a new machine. I thought it would be interesting to go through my 'bag-o-tricks' as far as what I install.</p>  <p>These apps are free. Some are free as in beer; some are free as in speech (or as Stallman says, free as in freedom).</p>  <p>I'd love to know what other people have in their must-install list for a new machine. I might be missing something awesome.</p>  <p><strong>Windows Live Messenger &amp; Writer</strong>: <a title="http://get.live.com/wl/all" href="http://get.live.com/wl/all">http://get.live.com/wl/all</a></p>  <p>Still going strong with two great apps. My humble requests:</p>  <ul>   <li>Messenger guys: please save my preferences on the server. I hate re-configuring tabs, welcome screen, contact grouping, sounds, etc. </li>    <li>Writer guys: please fix your support for images in <a href="http://blogger.com">Blogger</a>. This is my only complaint. </li> </ul>  <p><strong>Paint .NET</strong>: <a title="http://www.getpaint.net/" href="http://www.getpaint.net/">http://www.getpaint.net/</a></p>  <p>I will admit to frequently lusting after a licence to Adobe Photoshop. No longer. An amazing app that just keeps getting better and keeps staying free. Awesome.</p>  <p><strong>.NET Reflector</strong>: <a title="http://www.aisto.com/roeder/dotnet/" href="http://www.aisto.com/roeder/dotnet/">http://www.aisto.com/roeder/dotnet/</a></p>  <p>If you code .NET, this gets installed before VS. Amazing. Also keeps getting better.</p>  <p><strong>Firefox</strong>: <a title="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/" href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/">http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/</a></p>  <p>Yes, I'm one of those guys.    <br />Yes, I have friends that work on IE.     <br />Yes, I wish them well.</p>  <p>But...</p>  <p>I believe in open standards. The only way to protect and encourage open standards is to have many prevalent implementations of said standards.</p>  <p>Firefox is just better. Even when it crashes, it remembers where I was flawlessly...something IE never does. It scales web sites in a (more) rational way. The extensibility is also amazing, as I share below.</p>  <p><strong>Greasemonkey: </strong><a title="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/748" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/748">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/748</a></p>  <p>What a clever concept. I really only use it for one script, though. Would love to know more good ones.</p>  <p><strong>Google Secure Pro Greasemonkey Script:</strong> <a title="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/5951" href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/5951">http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/5951</a></p>  <p>Later, I will go through all of the web apps and services I use, but here's a hit: I use a lot of Google stuff.</p>  <p>Google supports HTTPS (SSL) on most of it's properties, but not by default. You have to put http<strong>s</strong>:// manually in the URL.</p>  <p>This script does that automatically for a whole host of Google properties. It's also extensible for any web site. (Like <a href="http://sneakemail.com/">sneakemail</a>, which I'll go into in another post.)</p>  <p><strong>Flash Blocker</strong>: <a title="http://flashblock.mozdev.org/" href="http://flashblock.mozdev.org/">http://flashblock.mozdev.org/</a></p>  <p>Another great Firefox add-on. This one replaces all flash content with a little arrow. When you press it, the flash loads but not before.</p>  <p>Great for seeing only the content you want to see and nothing else.</p>  <p><strong>Sumartra PDF</strong>: <a title="http://blog.kowalczyk.info/software/sumatrapdf/" href="http://blog.kowalczyk.info/software/sumatrapdf/">http://blog.kowalczyk.info/software/sumatrapdf/</a>&#xA0;</p>  <p>See my comment about many implementations of open standards. This is a solid client. It doesn't support all of the bells and whistles of Adobe Acrobat, but it's super small and doesn't install any tray icons or run any background services. Kudos.</p>  <p><strong>Skype</strong>: <a title="http://www.skype.com/" href="http://www.skype.com/">http://www.skype.com/</a></p>  <p>Great for chatting with the folks and the brothers.</p>  <p>My parents are doing video conferencing.</p>  <p>Scary.</p>  <p><strong>Notepad++</strong>: <a title="http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net/uk/site.htm" href="http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net/uk/site.htm">http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net/uk/site.htm</a></p>  <p>You can guess: a better version of notepad. Much better.</p>  <p>Support for syntax highlighting for multiple formats (C#, Xml, Ruby, etc.), a convenient shell context menu, tabs, the whole sha-bang.</p>  <p>I discovered this years ago. It keeps getting better.</p>  <p>For those times when you don't want to wait for VS to load.</p>  <p><strong>Process Explorer</strong>: <a title="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/sysinternals/Utilities/ProcessExplorer.mspx" href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/sysinternals/Utilities/ProcessExplorer.mspx">http://www.microsoft.com/technet/sysinternals/Utilities/ProcessExplorer.mspx</a></p>  <p>Last, but not least.</p>  <p>Ever want to delete a file and not know which process was keeping it open? This is the tool.</p>  <p>From our friends at SysInternals (that are now our friends in the Windows Kernel team).</p>  <p><strong>What did I miss?</strong></p>  <p>I'd love to know about *your* bag-o-tricks. I'll re-post anything I find useful.</p>  <p>Share the love and have a great Saturday.</p>
