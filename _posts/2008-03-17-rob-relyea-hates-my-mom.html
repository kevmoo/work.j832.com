<p><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="276" alt="Mom, Dad, Kevin" src="http://j832.com/workBlogFiles/_images/RobRelyeaHatesmyMom_956D/image.png" width="324" border="0" /> </p>  <p>My mother is a lovely woman. So I'm confused as to why <a href="http://blogs.windowsclient.net/rob_relyea/">Rob</a> dislikes her so much.</p>  <p>Let me back up. Last August (when I was still at my <a href="http://microsoft.com">former employer</a>) I <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/showpost.aspx?postid=332987">did some demos</a> of new features in WPF 3.5 for Channel 9.</p>  <p>I was happy to see Rob reused some of the same demos for <a href="http://sessions.visitmix.com/?selectedSearch=t11">his MIX '08 Talk</a>.</p>  <p>When I was watching the Add-In demo, I was surprise to see the data had remained the same--for the most part. My dad--Robert, my brothers--Brian and John, and I were still in the data set.</p>  <p><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="612" alt="image" src="http://j832.com/workBlogFiles/_images/RobRelyeaHatesmyMom_956D/image_3.png" width="656" border="0" /> </p>  <p>But my mother--Wynette--replaced by &quot;Web Service&quot;. I mean, I know WCF is powerful, but it's a poor replacement for the most wonderful woman in the world--even if she has an uncommon name.</p>  <p>I did find it funny that the last name was left unchanged.</p>  <p><a href="http://j832.com/workBlogFiles/_images/RobRelyeaHatesmyMom_956D/image_4.png"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="180" alt="image" src="http://j832.com/workBlogFiles/_images/RobRelyeaHatesmyMom_956D/image_thumb.png" width="244" border="0" /></a> </p>  <p>So come on Relyea. Let's hear it. I think I deserve an explanation. :-)</p>
