<p>Scenario:</p>  <ol>   <li>I sent out email to many people via BCC. </li>    <li>I get a bunch of replies to this email. </li>    <li>I want to reply in kind to these incoming messages, but GMail doesn't show which received messages I've replied to. </li> </ol>  <p>Suggestions:</p>  <ol>   <li>Give the option of the standard threaded discussion via. While GMail's interface is better in most scenarios, there are cases where a tree is better. </li>    <li>At minimum, give some indication that I've replied to a message. With many messages stacked in a thread, I can't figure out which I've replied to and which I haven't. </li> </ol>  <p>You have until next Friday, or I'm going back to Hotmail.</p>  <p>I bet if I wait long enough, Microsoft will give me $.05 for every email I send.</p>
