<p>Amar was my GPM (manager's manager) in the Longhorn days. (Yes, back when Vista had a lot more managed code and was going to change the world.)</p>  <p>He's one of the stars in the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KOEbAZJTTk">intro video</a> for Google's <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/opensocial/">openSocial</a>. (Look for the Indian guy in the Brazilian soccer jersey.)</p>  <p>I can't wait to start hacking on this stuff.</p>  <p>The last time you may have <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Showpost.aspx?postid=80533">seen him on video</a> was when he was GPM of the RSS team at Microsoft. (Interviewed by <a href="http://scobleizer.com/">Scoble</a>, none the less. A lot can change in three years, huh?)</p>  <p><a href="http://notstatic.com/">Robby</a> is <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Showpost.aspx?postid=353035">on channel9 again</a>, chatting the goodness of the 'integrator' role in WPF/Silverlight development. He's a main guy at <a href="http://www.identitymine.com/">identity mine</a> these days.</p>  <p>Robby and I worked together on the WPF team in the v1 days. The last time you may have <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Showpost.aspx?postid=222817">seen him on channel9</a> was with yours truly. Although I'd rather forget the topic. :-)</p>
